A simple fruitninja clone built in Processing to interface with the Leap Motion Controller or mouse.

Installation:
To use the Leap Motion controller, add the following files to Fruit_Ninja/code:
- LeapJava.jar
- lib_LeapJava.dylib
- libLeap.dylib

Then to run it, just run Fruit_Ninja/FruitNinja.pde

TODO:
- Add hit counter
- Allow 2 players at once
- Add bombs

Thanks to our Professor for letting us borrow the controller!
